Here is a list of some of the books related to software development that I read in the last 10 years. This list contains books that taught me a lot to become the (hopefully decent) cloud engineer I am today. Some of those books are purely technical while others are about social interactions, arguably the most important part of the job.

I may take the time to write proper reviews of those books someday, although I am not sure it will add much value as there are tons of reviews for all those books already.

For now, I just wanted to list them here for anyone who might be curious what my professional influences and values look like.


# Architecture

## Building Microservices

| <a href="https://samnewman.io/books/building_microservices/" target="_blank">![Building Microservices](/assets/images/books/tech/building-microservices.jpg){: width="250" }</a> | With this book, Sam Newman does a great job at explaining what microservices are, when they are the right choice and when they are not. He also gives lots of practical advices.<br/><br/>I have seen several projects where microservices are used but the ins and outs are not well understood. This book should help avoid typical mistakes. A must-read for software architects and lead engineers.<br/><br/>Note that there is a <a href="https://samnewman.io/books/building_microservices_2nd_edition/" target="_blank">2nd edition</a> available (I haven't read it yet). |

## bla bla microservices bla bla

| <a href="http://jonasboner.com/bla-bla-microservices-bla-bla/" target="_blank">![blabla microservices bla bla](/assets/images/books/tech/bla-bla-microservices.png){: width="250" }</a> | Not a book, but I still wanted to have it in my list. To me, this keynote by Jonas Bon√©r is a classic and an essential read when working with microservices. It is from 2016 but still totally relevant. |

## Designing Data-Intensive Applications

| <a href="https://dataintensive.net/" target="_blank">![Designing Data-Intensive Applications](/assets/images/books/tech/data-intensive.png){: width="250" }</a> | Amazing book to understand the internals, pros and cons of different tools and technologies typically used to build data-intensive applications. This will allow to make the best decisions and trad-offs to build highly reliable, scalable and maintainable systems. |

# DevOps

## Accelerate

| <a href="https://itrevolution.com/product/accelerate/" target="_blank">![Accelerate](/assets/images/books/tech/accelerate.jpg){: width="250" }</a> | An absolute classic. |

## State of DevOps reports

| <a href="https://www.devops-research.com/research.html#reports" target="_blank">![State of DevOps reports](/assets/images/books/tech/state-devops-2017.png){: width="250" }</a> | Still today (in 2023), I like to use the State of DevOps reports from a few years ago to explain and evangalize the devops mindset (I recommend the 2017 report in particular). |

# Sociology in software engineering

## Team Topologies

| <a href="https://teamtopologies.com/" target="_blank">![Team Topologies](/assets/images/books/tech/team-topologies.jpg){: width="250" }</a> | Great resource on how to organize technology teams for fast flow. Highly recommended.  |

## Peopleware

| <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/67825.Peopleware" target="_blank">![Peopleware](/assets/images/books/tech/peopleware.png){: width="250" }</a> | Oldie but godie.<br/><br/>_"The major problems of our work are not so much_ technological _as_ sociological _in nature"_.<br/><br/>Indeed... |

## The Psychological Safety Playbook

| <a href="https://thepsychologicalsafetyplaybook.com/" target="_blank">![The Psychological Safety Playbook](/assets/images/books/tech/psychological-safety-playbook.png){: width="250" }</a> | I am a strong believer that it is possible to be a great professional and a nice and relaxed person at the same time. The concept of psychological safety is also related to this in my opinion.<br/><br/>My former VP of Engineering at Autodesk, Minette Norman, co-authored this playbook which is packed with concrete things to do and improve to make the workplace a better place. In turn, this will lead to higher-performing teams as studies show. |

# People management

## The Manager's Path

| <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-managers-path/9781491973882/" target="_blank">![The Manager's Path](/assets/images/books/tech/manager-path.jpg){: width="250" }</a> | Excellent resource if you (aspire to) manage engineers. And still a lot to learn if you are an individual contributor. |
