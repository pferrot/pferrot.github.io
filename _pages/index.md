Hi! My name is Patrice Ferrot. I am a software engineer with a passion for
solving complex problems with open source technologies.

My areas of expertise:
* backend development
* web services
* cloud
* distributed systems
* devops

Over the last fourteen years, I have learnt to overcome a lot of the challenges
in those fields by applying the latest technics and using state-of-the art
technologies in real-world projects.

You can find more details in [my CV](/assets/doc/cv_web_patrice_ferrot.pdf).

## Career path
I have already occupied the following roles (in reverse chronological order):
* software architect at a large multinational tech company (current)
* technical lead and then head of development in a small saas company
* java/j2ee engineer in a service company
* junior java/j2ee engineer in a startup company
* independent web developer

## Current interests
During my spare time, I learn about blockchain in general and
[Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) in particular. I believe blockchain has the
potential to lead to something much bigger than the current hype around
cryptocurrencies.
