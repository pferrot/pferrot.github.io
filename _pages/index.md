I am a distributed systems software engineer with a passion for solving complex problems with open source technologies.

Distributed systems are complex but can solve very challenging problems. This is what I find most exciting in this field. Yet complexity remains an obstacle for many. I learnt to overcome a lot of that complexity by applying the latest technics in real-world projects.

My leitmotiv is to make my customers successful by building simple solutions to solve complex problems.

## Career path
I have already occupied the following roles (in reverse chronological order):
* software architect at a large multinational tech company (current)
* technical lead and then head of development in a small saas company
* java/j2ee engineer in a service company
* junior java/j2ee engineer in a startup company
* independent web developer

You can find more details in [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrice-ferrot-599743a).

## Current interests
During my spare time, I learn about blockchain in general and [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) in particular. I believe blockchain has the potential to lead to something much bigger than the current hype around cryptocurrencies.

## Contact
The best way to contact me is to send me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrice-ferrot-599743a) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/patriceferrot).
