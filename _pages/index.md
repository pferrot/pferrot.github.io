I am a **distributed systems software engineer** with a passion for solving complex problems with **open source** technologies. I am pragmatic and always keep in mind what problem we are trying to solve ("customer first"). I am capable of quickly understanding complex businesses. I will **architect, implement, operate and support** the most complex systems. I will then work myself out of the job – thanks to **automations** and knowledge transfer – to tackle the next challenging problem.

# Career path
I have already occupied the following roles (in reverse chronological order):
* software architect at a large multinational tech company (current)
* technical lead and then head of development in a small company
* java engineer in a service company
* junior j2ee engineer in a startup company
* independent web developer

You can find more details in [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrice-ferrot-599743a).

# Current interests
During my spare time, I learn about blockchain in general and [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org) in particular. I believe blockchain has the potential to lead to something much bigger than the current hype around cryptocurrencies.

# Contact
The best way to contact me is through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrice-ferrot-599743a) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/patriceferrot) accounts.
